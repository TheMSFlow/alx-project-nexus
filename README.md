##  Major Learnings

###  Key Technologies Covered

- **Next.js**: Server-side rendering, dynamic routing, and optimized performance.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **TypeScript**: Strong typing and code safety in JavaScript applications.
- **GraphQL**: Declarative data fetching and API schema design.
- **API Integration**: REST and GraphQL API consumption and interaction.
- **System Design and Analysis**: Planning, designing, and evaluating scalable systems.

---

### Important Frontend Development Concepts

- Component-based architecture with React/Next.js.
- Responsive and accessible UI development with TailwindCSS.
- Code maintainability and reusability using TypeScript interfaces and generics.
- Efficient state management with React hooks and context.
- Optimized data fetching with SWR and GraphQL queries/mutations.
- System scalability and performance considerations.
